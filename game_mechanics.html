        <p><strong>What</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>fortnite</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fortnite is a highly popular online multiplayer free-to-play third-person battle royale shooter where 100 players are dropped onto an ever-shrinking island, fighting to be the last team or person standing. This game also includes a building mechanic which allows players to construct structures for cover and also offers a strategic advantage. This unique building system allows players to get materials from the surroundings to construct these structures. Fortnite has a diverse arsenal with a constantly evolving landscape and seasonal updates. Don’t forget about Fortnite's diverse heals and mobility constantly being added to the game to move faster around the map and keep your health up. Fortnite also includes cross-platform, social interactions online and in-game purchases. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;<strong>What</strong> <strong>Player</strong> <strong>Need</strong> <strong>Improvement</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;The players who need the most advice on improving in Fortnite are new players who are considered noobs slang for newbies or newcomers. These players are still learning the ropes of the game and lack advanced gameplay. These low-skill level players are most vulnerable to mid-level and advanced players who are past learning the ropes and have more advanced gameplay. As a mid-level advance-ish player I can help new players get better by showing them good mechanics and good skills to get better at the game. These new players can add this advice to their gameplay to get better and win those matches.</p>

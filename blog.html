        <p>According to the article, people play games because of novelty, competence, exploration, risk-taking, safe place to fail. Novelty because games keep life fun and engaging because they allow you to do something new. Competence because many video games require skill, which if you get good at it makes you feel mastery or control over the videogame. Exploration because it can make you explore what you like doing or what you want or explore an open world of a game. Risk-taking because in a virtual world taking risks can’t hurt you in real life, but you can lose your match or your rank. A safe place to fail because if you die, or lose a game you can play another and be used as a skill in the real world because you learn from your mistakes. </p>

        <p>&nbsp; I agree with this person that Fortnite is a very fun game to play with friends and it is for everyone. I also agree that it's good for being social because it can help with team-building skills and communication skills. What don’t agree with about this review is that this game is easy to play and use. This game is not that easy because there is a lot of competition and very skilled based.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;Corsair Vengence i7400,&nbsp; This would be a good computer for me because I like to play on high graphics and high fps. It also has the latest tech in it; RTX 4090, Windows 11 Pro, Intel core i9-13900k, 3GHz, and could download the latest games. This pc is also not too big so it won’t take up to much space. </p>

<p>&nbsp;Toxicity in Gaming is when gamers rationalize by harassing others in a video game in different ways. This is important to understand because it can have negative long-term effects and can lead to depressive and suicidal thoughts in players getting harassed. To combat this issue big companies like EA, Infinity Ward, and Valve have developed a moderation tool to stop players from being toxic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite professional esports team is NRG. What makes NRG a team good is they are very skilled at any game they play. What this team does well is they play the games very well and are very skilled and communicate well with each other. What this team needs to work on is always improving their skills. NRG&nbsp;</p>
